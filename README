projectX - README

This library is to accomadate programming, in particular to
add a layer that facilitates the transition between AVS
modules and standalone code.

The makefiles assume that AVS is installed in /usr/avs.
However AVS is _not_ required to compile the standalone
library, despite the makefile requirements. An AVS-free
makefile has yet to become part of the standard distribution,
but direction are further below.

see projectX_interface.h for an idea of it's content.

HOWTO INSTALL (assuming AVS is installed in /usr/avs)

1) get the files:
	$ wget http://zaphod/svn/projectX/tags/projectX-*.*.tar.gz

2) untar
	$ tar xfz projectX.tar.gz

2) change to the expanded directory
	$ cd projectX

3) compile the library
	$ make

4) install as root
	$ sudo make install


If you can't do the root thing just fix your makefiles appropriately.



To compile the library when AVS is not availible change 3 and 4 of the
above directions

3) compile the library
	$ make -f Makefile.standalone

4) install as root
	$ sudo make -f Makefile.standalone install
